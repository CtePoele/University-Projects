# UTD-Projects
A showcase of my coding abilities and improvement over my time at the University of Texas at Dallas

## Mimic Win7 Calculator
My first project done in Java 2 months after starting to learn it. The project's focus was on JPanels and incorporating functions into a working calculator GUI that resembled Windows 7's calculator. Done during my 3rd semester at UTD.

## Text-based Classic Connect 4
My first project done in the MIPS assembly language.  The project's focus was applying what we learned in class to make a game coded in MARS MIPS (https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/), which in my case, Connect 4. Done during my 5th semester at UTD.

## Bank Teller Scenario
A project done in Java that focused around semaphores/asynchronous thread handling. The project's focus was on recreating a bank teller scenario where bankers served customers' banking requests. Done during my 7th semester at UTD.
